  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>

<p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Martina Tibaldi</strong>, and I am an energy engineering. 
    
Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at <strong>Uppsala University</strong>, where my research focuses on <em>Energy Communities, Microgrids, and Electric Vehicles (EVs)</em>. I believe that electrification is vital for a successful transition to a sustainable, fossil-free society. However, capacity bottlenecks in the electric grid threaten to slow down this transition. My work aims to contribute to the development of smart, safe, and resilient energy communities, particularly by creating a framework for effective microgrid management.
</p>

<h2>Current Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    My research is centered around a project based at <strong>Dansm√§staren</strong>, a test bed for research on smart EV charging and energy management located in Uppsala. This project will unfold over four years, focusing on the following objectives:
</p>

<h3>Year 1: Data Collection and Initial Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Collect data from the three different entities of the mobility hub at Dansm√§staren.</li>
    <li>Engage with various stakeholders to plan the data acquisition process for seamless integration into the existing energy management system.</li>
    <li>Familiarize myself with the hardware and software used for testing in a real environment and the overall energy management system.</li>
    <li>Conduct a state-of-the-art review and draft my first scientific article.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 2: Deepening Understanding of Energy Communities</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Explore the potential of Dansm√§staren to become a successful energy community, addressing challenges and regulatory issues.</li>
    <li>Develop an energy flow model of the building based on the data collected in Year 1.</li>
    <li>Participate in experimental work at the √Öngstr√∂m Lab and Dansm√§staren, collaborating with the research team.</li>
    <li>Write a second scientific article and present a conference paper.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 3: Validation and Stakeholder Engagement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Continue data analysis and validate the energy flow model developed in Year 2 with experimental data.</li>
    <li>Intensify contact with stakeholders of the mobility hub, particularly Stuns.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the socio-economic potential of the mobility hub while working closely with the research group.</li>
    <li>Draft the third scientific article.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 4: Integration and Dissemination</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Integrate Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) charging into my model.</li>
    <li>Outreach to relevant parties to disseminate results and insights from my research.</li>
    <li>Evaluate user behavior and acceptance regarding participation in flexibility services.</li>
    <li>Write a fourth scientific article and prepare a conference paper for presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I am currently in Year 1 and have started conducting experiments on the parking facilities at Dansm√§staren while getting acquainted with the project environment.
